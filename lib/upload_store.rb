# Public: Uploads are all two stage. First files are uploaded from the client
# to the uploads directory where they are staged until they are processed
# and permanently moved to the photo directory. This is done to achieve the
# most platform flexibility possible. For our initial implementation we will be
# using XHR2 and CORS to upload files to S3 and then processing the uploaded
# files with another process. This means that rails doesn't have to be
# responsible for the connection while transferring the file.
